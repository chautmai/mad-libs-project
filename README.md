Mad Libs Generator Mini Project

This is a text-based Mad Libs Generator where the user will be asked to answers questions related to their personal and career information for the program to generate a basic introduction paragraph filled with the answers they previously typed in. 

This project is used with the knowledge of string concatination and basic loops to get user's response and change behaviors based on their answers.

This project is fully used from the command line so basic knowledge of working with the terminal is necessary to perform this program properly.
